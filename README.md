Statement：

仓库中所有代码谨为记录曾经无数个深夜拼搏在大作业上的自己。

All the code is a record of my struggles with homeworks during countless late nights.

如果对您的学习思路有帮助，我会很高兴，因为你和当初迷茫在大作业中的我也许很像，**但请不要抄袭，切记！**

If it is helpful to you, I will be glad, as you might be similar to me who was once confused in homeworks. However, **please do not plagiarize, Keep this in mind!**
